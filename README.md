# RedditSearchDiscordBot
This a discord bot with 2 features:

search the r/dailyprogrammer subreddit. This is a subreddit where, as the name suggests, programming challenges are uploaded everyday. These challenges are classified into 3 difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. By sending a message starting with "$" followed by either easy, medium, or hard, the bot will return the title and url to a challenge of that difficulty.

search any subreddit. Typing "$search subreddit_name keyword" will have the bot returning the title and url of a post from the specified subreddit with a title containing that keyword.

Additionally the bot has a $help command where it gives a list of commands available.
